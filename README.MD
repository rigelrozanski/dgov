# Decentralized Governance

The goal of decentralized governance development is to create a tool-suite for communities 
around the world to improve their capacity for fair decision making. The following are 
high level goals of the project: 
 - Documentation 
   - Philosophical guidance documentation on choosing styles of governance for/with your community 
     - transition guidelines for different styles of existing governance (hard/soft transitions) 
   - Detailed "on the ground" implementation guideline
     - This refers to required educational materials / teaching guides to use of a particular system 
   - Detailed technical implementation guidelines 
     - multi-phase implementation for tiered approach 
       - piggy-backing on an existing blockchain prior to building out autonomous validator set
 - Generalized Implementation
   - extensible/customizable voting systems
   - allowance for special-permission actors within systems
     - allowance for DAO actors/ sub-group actors of a blockchain
   - stablecoin requirements 
   - zero-knowledge (through-zone) requirements
