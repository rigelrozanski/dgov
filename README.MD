# Decentralized Governance

The goal of decentralized governance development is to create a tool-suite for communities 
around the world to improve their capacity for fair decision making. The following are 
high level goals of the project: 
 1) Software-infrastructure implementation to support decentralized governance, 
 2) Comprehensive transition documentation,
 3) Creation of a board game for experimentation (Nonopoly), 
 4) Real-world trial implementation. 

## Software-Implementation
   - extensible/customizable voting systems
   - allowance for special-permission actors within systems
     - allowance for DAO actors/ sub-group actors of a blockchain
   - stablecoin requirements 
   - zero-knowledge (through-zone) requirements

## Documentation 
   - Philosophical guidance documentation on choosing styles of governance for/with your community 
     - transition guidelines for different styles of existing governance (hard/soft transitions) 
   - Detailed "on the ground" implementation guideline
     - This refers to required educational materials / teaching guides to use of a particular system 
   - Detailed technical implementation guidelines 
     - multi-phase implementation for tiered approach 
       - piggy-backing on an existing blockchain prior to building out autonomous validator set

## Board Game 

In order to experiment with different possibilities for the  

## Real-World Trial Implementation

An experimental trial implementation of the principles of running a community
on liquid democracy should be boot-strapped. 

### Option 1: New Community
### Option 2: Existing City

## Execution Strategy 

Within one year of project inception, a working prototype network should be
created.  


## Core Development Team

Team Lead/Technical Lead: Rigel Rozanski

Initial Advisors: 
 - Jae (Expertise in Tendermint/Cosmos)
 - Bucky (Involvement in Tendermint/Cosmos/Canadian-Law)
 - Sunny (Incredible with Blockchains Generally)  
 - Dev (Zero Knowledge Specialization)

In addition to Rigel which will also lead and contribute to the development
cycles an additional 4 new developers should be brought into the core
development within the first year of project inception as full time
contributors. Ideally, 1 of those developers will be an intern, and 1 
will be a web developer. 

Beyond developers, other non-explicitly-technical team members should be hired
notably in the fields of philosophy, economics, aesthetics, and communication,
ideally as much inter-disciplinary overlap in team members occurs. 

### Funding 

### Team Integration with AIB/ICF 

It is anticipated that this newly formed team will work closely with the
AIB-Cosmos-SDK team to advance common interests, both through the development
of new modules but also through the improvement and on-going maintenance of
core Cosmos-SDK code. 

Similarly it is anticipated that a on-going communication and coordination 
occurs between the ICF and the 

### Long Term Autonomy of the Team

The ultimate long-term goal is to create a decentralized community
with physical locations ultimately capable of supporting the livelihoods
of the members involved. This community ought not to have any form 
of centralized control beyond what is prescribed by the community members.

Some form of organization should be utilized as a relayer of funds  

The for the original development team a formation of a new autonomous wing
of either the ICF of AIB should be created. Eventually a new non-for-profit 
organization could be created, mostly to serve as a payment channel
